This is the engine behind a game for the AnyObject Platform that simtable is working on. 
The user interface is supplied by AnyObject and is not included in this repo. That being said it should be fairly easy to add a user interface. 


The original Electric Field Hockey was written by Dr. Ruth Chabay back in the day.
